		In a 3D plot the scatter of points, one for each time series, for the 
		triple of the three selected measures will be shown. This visualization 
		is particular useful to identify graphically cluster of time series with 
		respect to the three selected measures.</span><p><span lang="en-us">Two 
		or more time series can be selected from the time series list having the 
		title <b>Select time series</b> and exactly three measures must be 
		selected from the measure list having the title <b>Select three measures</b>. 
		For measures defined in terms of one or more measure specific 
		parameters, the measure name regards a specified set of parameters (one 
		parameter value for each name). A subset of time series names can be 
		selected from the respective lists with standard use of the mouse: a 
		click on a name and Shift^click on a another name further down in the 
		list selects all names between the former and the latter; a click on a 
		name and subsequent Ctrl^clicks on other names select these names 
		including the first name; Ctrl^a selects the whole list. To select the 
		three measures, click on the first measure name and then Ctrl^click on 
		the other two measure names.</span></td>
