      <td colspan="2" align="justify"><span lang="en-us">Basically two measures 
		of nonlinear correlation are included, the bicorrelation and the mutual 
		information. The <i>bicorrelation</i>, or three-point autocorrelation, 
		or higher order correlation, is the joint moment of three variables 
		formed from the time series and two delays <i>t</i> and <i>s</i>. A simplified 
		scenario for the delays is implemented, <i>s </i>= 2<i>t</i>, so the bicorrelation is E[<i>x</i>(<i>i</i>),
		<i>x</i>(<i>i</i>+<i>t</i>), <i>x</i>(<i>i</i>+2<i>t</i>)], 
		where the mean value is estimated by the sample average. In 
		this way, the bicorrelation is a function of a single delay <i>t</i>. The <i>mutual 
		information</i> is defined for two variables <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> as the amount of 
		information that is known for the one variable when the other is given, 
		and it is computed from the joint and single entropies of <i>X</i> and 
		<i>Y</i>. For 
		time series, <i>X </i>= <i>x</i>(<i>i</i>) and&nbsp; Y = <i>x</i>(<i>i</i>+<i>t</i>) for a delay 
		<i>t</i>, so that the mutual 
		information is a function of the delay <i>t</i> that measures the linear and 
		nonlinear autocorrelation. There are a number of estimators of mutual 
		information based on histograms, kernels, nearest neighbors and splines. 
		Here, the histogram-based estimator is implemented using either 
		equidistant or equiprobable binning. Note that 
		the nonlinear correlation (bicorrelation, 
		equisitant and equiprobable mutual information) at each delay <i>t</i> 
		is a different measure, so that for a range of delay values the 
		same number of measures are generated.</span><p><span lang="en-us">In 
		addition to the nonlinear correlation measures of bicorrelation, 
		equisitant and equiprobable mutual information, the cumulative nonlinear 
		correlation measures are implemented as new measures that sum up 
		the magnitude of the nonlinear correlation over the delays up to a given delay.</span></p>
		<p><span lang="en-us">The first minimum of the mutual information function 
		is of special interest and the respective delay can be used either as a 
		discriminating measure or as the optimal delay for state space 
		reconstruction in time series analysis. This specific delay is computed for 
		both the equidistant and the equiprobable estimate of mutual 
		information.</span><p><span lang="en-us">The bicorrelation is not a 
		widely discussed measure, but the cumulative bicorrelation has been used 
		as a statistic for the test of linearity (or non-linearity as it is best 
		known in the dynamical systems approach of time series analysis), the 
		so-called Hinnich test, see </span>
