      <td colspan="2" align="justify"><span lang="en-us">The standard measure of 
		linear correlation in a time series is the autocorrelation given as a 
		function of the delay parameter. The autocorrelation for each delay <i>t</i> is 
		actually the Pearson correlation coefficient for the variable pair 
		(<i>x</i>(<i>i</i>), <i>x</i>(<i>i</i>+<i>t</i>)). In this sense, the autocorrelation at each delay 
		<i>t</i> can be 
		estimated by other estimates of the pair-wise correlation and here the 
		Kendall and Spearman correlation coefficients are also implemented 
		giving the Kendall and Spearman autocorrelation, respectively. Note that the autocorrelation (Pearson, Kendall, 
		Spearman) at different delays are considered as different measures, so that for a range of delay values the 
		same number of measures are generated. We consider in this group also 
		the partial autocorrelation that measures the correlation of the 
		variable pair (<i>x</i>(<i>i</i>), <i>x</i>(<i>i</i>+<i>t</i>)) 
		accounting for the intermediate variables <i>x</i>(<i>i+1</i>),...,<i>x</i>(<i>i+t-1</i>) 
		(partial autocorrelation is the same as Pearson autocorrelation for <i>t</i>=1).</span><p><span lang="en-us">In 
		addition to the autocorrelation functions, the cumulative autocorrelations 
		(Pearson, Kendall, Spearman) are implemented as new measures that sums up 
		the autocorrelation magnitudes for the delays up to a given delay. </span></p>
		<p><span lang="en-us">There are two special values of the 
		autocorrelation function and the respective delays are used in time series analysis: the decorrelation time, 
		i.e. the delay for which the autocorrelation falls for the first time to 
		the level 1/e, and the delay of zero autocorrelation, for which the 
		autocorrelation crosses zero for the first time. These specific delays 
		are computed for all three types of autocorrelation. </span>
		<p><span lang="en-us">The definition of the Pearson, Kendall and 
		Spearman correlation coefficients can be found in any standard textbook 
		of statistics. The Pearson autocorrelation is a basic tool of linear 
		analysis of time series and statistical description for this 
		(estimation, inference) can be found in any standard book on time 
		series analysis, e.g. see </span>
		<p><span lang="en-us">Box, G.E.P., Jenkins, G.M., and Reinsel, G.C. 
		(1994), <i>Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control</i>, 
		Prentice-Hall, Third Edition, New Jersey. </span>
		<p><span lang="en-us">The partial autocorrelation for each lag <i>t</i> 
		is the last coefficient of the autoregressive (AR) model of order <i>t</i> 
		and we implement the AR fitting to derive the partial autocorrelation 
		measure for different given lags. The reader may refer to the same book 
		for further details.</span><p><span lang="en-us">The implementation of Kendall 
		and Spearman correlation coefficient on the estimation of the 
		autocorrelation is not standard but may be useful in some cases, as when 
		the marginal distribution of a time series deviates substantially from 
		Gaussian. Note that the Kendall and Spearman autocorrelation&nbsp; 
		estimate correlations in the ranks of the samples in the time series 
		and therefore cannot be considered as linear measures. We call them <i>
		monotonic measures</i>, since their values do not change under monotonic 
		transforms of the time series.</span></td>
