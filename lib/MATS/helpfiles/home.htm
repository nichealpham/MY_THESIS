		Series Data Bases, Journal of Statistical Software, in press (2010)</font><p>
		<font size="4">The <i>
		Measures of Analysis of Time Series</i> (MATS) toolkit is a matlab-based product 
that aims at facilitating the computation of a large number of measures of scalar 
time series analysis on a number of time series. The strength of the MATS toolkit is the 
simultaneous operation on both multiple time series and multiple 
measures, allowing a range of measure specific parameters to be set as well.
</font> 
		</p>
<p><font size="4">A main feature of MATS is that it keeps track of two lists: 
the <i>time series 
list</i> containing the set of scalar time series to be analyzed, and the <i>measure 
list</i> containing the values of the selected measures computed on the time series 
in the current time series list. The time series list is dynamic so that time 
series can be deleted from the list and new time series can be added to the list 
by selecting specific data-related operations, i.e. loading time series 
files, standardizing or segmenting time series from the list, or generating resampled (surrogate) time series 
(left part of the main menu window). 
A number of various measures of different types (linear, nonlinear, others) can 
be selected. The selected measures are then computed on all the time series in 
the current time series list and the measure values are stored in the current measure list, 
where for 
each measure and for each combination of its parameter values a unique name is 
assigned (right part of the main menu window). The computed 
measures can be viewed in different ways by selecting measure names from the 
measure list and time series names from the time series list associated to the 
computed measures, 
e.g. plots of measures versus segment or surrogate time series index, or 
measures versus one or two varying parameters (2D and 3D plot). </font> </p>
<p><font size="4">The user can select many different measures, as well 
as measure specific parameters, compute them on different time series, and view 
the results on the different measures and time series. It should be noted that 
the computation for each selected measure can be slow when a large number of time series 
are selected or the length of the time series is large (or both). Also, some measures, such as the 
measure of the local linear model and the measure of the correlation dimension, 
require long computation time.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="5">Data-related operations</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="4">Load time series </font></b><font size="4">Different data formats can be read. So far, 
the formats implemented are for plain text (ascii), excel (xls), matlab data 
files (mat) and the edf format used specifically for EEG records. All loaded 
data are organized in vector form with unique names (one name for each scalar 
time series). For example, if a data matrix of three columns is read from a file, 
the user can select to store in the current time series list any of the three 
time series with a name starting with the file name, followed by the character 
'C' (for column) and the index of the corresponding column in the data matrix.</font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Segment</b></font><b><font size="4"> time series </font>
</b><font size="4">In some applications, a long time series record is available 
and the analysis is done on consecutive or overlapping segments from this 
record. This may be the case if the interest is to detect changes in the 
underlying system of the observed data record. Thus one or more measures are 
estimated on the segments and the change can be possibly be observed in the 
derived series of measures. The user can generate consecutive or overlapping 
segments of a number of selected time series. The segmented time series get a 
coded name with a running index and are stored in the current time series list.</font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Transform</b></font><b><font size="4"> time series </font></b>
<font size="4">
Before applying tools of analysis on time series, often the time series are 
first transformed or/and standardized in order to fulfill certain conditions for 
the analysis (stationarity, normality) or to bring time series at different 
range at the same standardized range. For transformation, there are four types: 
the Box Cox power transform attempts to make the magnitudes of the time series 
Gaussian, while the other three transforms (lag-difference, log-difference and 
detrend) aim to reduce non-stationarity of the time series. For standardization 
four different schemes are 
implemented (Gaussian, uniform, linear and normalized). The selected transformed 
or standardized time series get a coded name and are 
stored in the current time series list.</font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Surrogate time series </b>When analyzing time series, it is 
often of interest to test an hypothesis on the underlying to the time series 
system. Here we focus on the hypothesis of independent time series, of Gaussian 
linear process and of linear stochastic process. Many of the offered measures 
can be used as test statistics for these tests and the resampling approach can 
be used to carry out the test by generating randomized or bootstrap time series. 
The resampled time series get a coded name with a running index and are stored 
in the current time series list.</font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Save time series </b>The user can save any of the time 
series in the current time series list generated by the abovementioned 
operations. The saving formats implemented are for plain text (ascii), excel (xls) 
and matlab data files (mat).</font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b>View time series </b>There three options that are displayed 
in this popup menu. The first is denoted as '1D' and choosing this time history plots (1D plot) can be 
generated for a number of selected time series. This can be particularly useful 
to see all segments of a time series together or surrogate time series along the 
original time series. The second choice is denoted as '2D/3D' for the generation 
of scatter plots in two and three dimensions (2D / 3D 
plots) for one time series at a time. This is useful when 
underlying deterministic dynamics are investigated and the user want to get a 
projected view of the hypothesized underlying attractor. The third choice is 
denoted as 'histogram' for the generation of histogram plots (as bars or lines) 
for selected time series. </font> </p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Sort by size</b> and <b>Sort by name</b> allow to sort the 
time series in the current time series list by size and name, respectively. <b>
Delete </b>allows to delete time series from the current time series list.</font></p>
		<p><font size="4"><b>Table of selected time series</b> This selection opens a 
		sheet having three columns and rows as many as the selected time series. 
		For each row, the cell in the first column contains the time series 
		name, the cell in the second column contains the data values of the time 
		series that can be seen by clicking on it, and the cell in the third 
		column displays the length of the time series. This option allows the 
		user to copy and paste the time series content to another file or sheet 
		like excel.&nbsp;
</font> </p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Time series name notation</b> This selection opens a window 
showing a list of the special characters used in the names of the time series.&nbsp;
</font> </p>
<p><font size="4">Messages regarding the selected operations may be given to the 
text box titled <i>Running messages</i>.</font></p>
<p><font size="5"><b>Measure</b></font><b><font size="5">-related operations</font></b></p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Select / Run measures</b> A large number of measures from 
simple to sophisticated can be selected that are organized in groups. The main 
groups are linear measures, nonlinear measures and &quot;other&quot; measures, and each 
contains other groups, e.g. the group of linear measures contains correlation, 
frequency-based and model-based measures. Many of the measures require one or 
more parameters being specified. The default values are mostly chosen under the 
criterion of simplicity and there are often not the most appropriate. After 
navigation in the different measure groups and upon selection of the measures 
the hard and most important task of computation execution starts. Note that each 
selected measure is computed possibly for a given range of values for one or 
more parameters and for the whole set of time series in the current time series 
list, so execution time can vary according to the number and length of the 
selected time series as well as the selected measures and parameters. Some 
nonlinear measures, such as the correlation dimension and the local linear fit 
and prediction, are computationally rather involved and may require long time. 
When execution is finished the name of measure and parameters are listed in the 
measure list. Each name regards an array of values of length equal to the number 
of time series in the time series list at the moment of execution of the measure 
computations. </font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b>Save measures</b> The table of the computed measure values 
(rows) for the selected time series (columns) can be saved in a file. The file 
can be plain ascii, excel (.xls) and matlab data file (.mat).</font></p>
<p><font size="4"><b>View measures</b> This option allows the user to view any 
parts of the table of the computed measure values (rows) for the selected time 
series (columns). Selected parts can be shown in a separate table or in a &quot;free 
plot&quot;. When measures are computed on segmented or surrogate time series, 
selected measures (as well as selected parameter values for the same measure) 
can be drawn against the segment or surrogate indices (for the latter the 
measure values for the original are displayed as well). This allows to detect 
differences across segments (i.e. in time evolution) or between original and 
surrogate time series. For measures computed for a range of one or more 
parameters, the measures on selected time series can be plotted against one 
parameter (2D plot) or a measure on one selected time series can be plotted 
against two parameters (3D plot). This type of plots can show the dependence of 
the measure on one or two parameters for the selected time series. Further, two 
or three selected measures (including specific parameter values) can be used as 
coordinates fro a 2D and 3D plot, respectively, where the drawn points regard 
the different time series. This type of plots allows to identify cluster of time 
series with respect to estimated measures. </font></p>
<p><font size="4">Each measure is given a label and the specific choice of a 
parameter is coded by a character followed by the value (multiplied by 100 if 
its range is positive and smaller than one). The concatenation of these strings 
constitutes the name of the specific measure. Thus it is quite hard to identify 
the measure from such string names. It is helpful to check the <b>Measure 
parameter name notation</b> that shows a list of the parameters and their label.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="5">Possible uses of the MATS toolkit</font></b></p>
<p><font size="4">Here follows some possible uses of the MATS toolkit that are 
supported with special visualization options.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">- <i>Detection of regime change in long data records</i>: 
allowing for computing a measure on consecutive segments of a long data record 
and detecting on the series of measure values abrupt or smooth changes as well 
as trends. </font></p>
<p><font size="4">- <i>Surrogate data test for nonlinearity</i>: allowing the 
selection of different surrogate data generating algorithms and many different 
test statistics.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">- <i>Discrimination ability of different measures</i>: 
comparing different measures with respect to their power in discriminating 
different types of time series.</font></p>
<p><font size="4">- <i>Assessing the dependence of a measure on measure specific 
parameters</i>: visualizing the measure as a function of its parameters and 
comparing the dependence of the measure on its parameters for different types of 
time series. </font></p>
<p><font size="4">- <i>Feature-based clustering of time series data base</i>, 
computing a set of measures (features) on a set of time series (for two or three 
features the clusters can be seen in a 2D or 3D plot). For quantitative results, 
the array of measure data has to be fed in a feature-based clustering algorithm 
(we currently work on developing such a tool and link it to MATS).</font></p>
