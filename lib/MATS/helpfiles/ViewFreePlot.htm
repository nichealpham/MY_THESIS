		This operation is useful to visualize the dependence of any measure on 
		selected time series, as well as the difference of this dependence 
		across different time series. </span>
		<p><span lang="en-us">Two or more time series can be selected from the 
		time series list having the title <b>Select two or more time series</b>.&nbsp; 
		Also, one or more measures can be selected from the measure list having 
		the title <b>Select one or more measures</b>. For measures defined in 
		terms of one or more measure specific parameters, the measure name 
		regards a specified set of parameters (one parameter value for each 
		name). A subset of time series names or measure names can be selected 
		from the respective lists with standard use of the mouse: a click on a 
		name and Shift^click on a another name further down in the list selects 
		all names between the former and the latter; a click on a name and 
		subsequent Ctrl^clicks on other names select these names including the 
		first name; Ctrl^a selects the whole list.</span></td>
