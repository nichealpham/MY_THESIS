		different classes of nonlinear models, the <i>local state space models</i> 
		are implemented here. This class is popular in nonlinear analysis of 
		time series because it is effective for fitting and prediction tasks and 
		it is intuitively simple. Different variations of the local model are 
		implemented, and different statistical measures of fitting and 
		prediction can be derived for a number of varying model specific 
		parameters. These are the <i>delay </i>(<i>t</i>),
		<i>embedding dimension</i> (<i>m</i>), <i>number of neighbors</i> (<i>k</i>) 
		and <i>prediction times</i> (<i>h</i>). </span>
		<p><span lang="en-us">T</span>he local region <span lang="en-us">

		<span lang="en-us">available</span> set<span lang="en-us"> of

		speed up computation time in the search of&nbsp;neighboring points<span lang="en-us">, 
		as implemented by Guy Shechter. The routines are written in C and they 
		are converted to matlab functions. They should run in Windows and Linux 
		operational systems without any problems.
		</span>The <span lang="en-us">point </span>distance<span lang="en-us">s</span>
		<span lang="en-us">are</span> computed using the Euclidean (L2) norm.</p>
		<p><span lang="en-us">The difference between the fitting and prediction 
		measures is in the set of samples that are used to compute the 
		statistical measure: all the samples are used for fitting and the 
		samples in the so-called test set are used for prediction. Here, the 
		test set is the last part of the time series given by the parameter of <i>
		fraction for test set</i> (<i>f</i>). For multi-step fit or prediction, 
		both the direct and iterative schemes are implemented. For the direct 
		fit or prediction at a lead time
		<i>h</i>, the <i>h</i>-step ahead mappings are used to form the estimate 
		of the target points at a lead time <i>h</i>, whereas for the iterative 
		fit or prediction, the one step predictions from previous steps are used 
		to make predictions for the current step until the <i>h</i>-step is 
		reached. </span></p>
		<p><span lang="en-us">The local models implemented here are listed 
		below, where the task is to predict <i>h</i>-step ahead from a current 
		state <i><b>x</b><sub>i</sub></i>, where all states (points) are 
		reconstructed with a delay <i>t</i> 
		and an embedding dimension <i>m, </i>and the local model is estimated on 
		the basis of the <i>k</i> nearest neighbors of <i><b>x</b><sub>i</sub></i>, 
		denoted as <i><b>x</b><sub>i</sub></i><sub>(<i>j</i>)</sub>, for <i>j</i>=1,...,<i>k</i>. 
		The selection of the specific model is determined by the value of the 
		so-called <i>truncation parameter</i> (<i>q</i>).&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p><span lang="en-us">- The <i>local average model</i> (LAM), called 
		also model of zero order, predicts <i>x</i><sub><i>i</i>+<i>h</i></sub>&nbsp; 
		from the average of the mappings of the neighbors at lead time <i>h</i>, 
		i.e. <i>x<sub>i</sub></i><sub>(<i>j</i>)+<i>h</i></sub>, for <i>j</i>=1,...,<i>k</i>. 
		This model is selected by <i>q </i>= 0.</span></p>
		<p><span lang="en-us">- The <i>local linear model</i> (LLM) is the 
		linear autoregressive model <i>x</i><sub><i>i</i>+<i>h</i></sub> = a<sub>0</sub>

		the neighboring points <i><b>x</b><sub>i</sub></i><sub>(<i>j</i>)</sub>, 
		for <i>j</i>=1,...,<i>k</i>. The parameters a<sub>0</sub> and <b>a </b>
		are estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS) and this requires that <i>
		k </i>&gt; <i>m</i>+1. The prediction <i>x</i><sub><i>i</i>+<i>h</i></sub> 
		is computed from the equation above for the target point <i><b>x</b><sub>i</sub></i>. 
		Note that the solution for the model parameters may be numerically 
		unstable if <i>k</i> is close to <i>m</i>. This model is selected by 
		using any <i>q </i><font face="Times New Roman">&#8805; </font><i>m</i>.</span></p>
		<p><span lang="en-us">- The <i>local linear model</i> as above but&nbsp; 
		regularizing the OLS solution for the model parameters with principal 
		component regression (PCR). PCR rotates the parameter space to match the 
		basis formed by the principal components (found by Singular Value 
		Decomposition (SVD) of the matrix formed by the neighboring points). 
		Then the space is projected to the subspace formed by the <i>q</i> 
		first principal axes, the solution for the parameters is found in this 
		subspace and it is transformed back to the original state space to yield 
		the PCR regularized solution for the parameters. In this way, the 
		estimated parameters have smaller variance (they are more stable) at the 
		cost of an introduced bias. Another advantage is that PCR may at cases 
		reduce the effect of noise. The condition for the PCR solution is that <i>
		k </i>
		&gt; <i>q</i>+1, so that stable solutions can be reached even when <i>m </i>
		&gt;<i> k</i> 
		provided that the truncation parameter is sufficiently small. This

		<p><span lang="en-us">Four standard statistical measures are 
		encountered, the mean square error (MSE), the normalized mean square

		Local Average or Linear Iterative Prediction gives four statistical measures of goodness of 
		prediction 
		with a local model of order zero (the local average model, LAM) or one 
		(the local linear model, LLM). The local average or linear model is 
		estimated in the first part of the time series, the so-called training 
		set, and the predictions are made in the second part of the time series, 
		the so-called test set. A number of different delays, embedding 
		dimensions and number of neighbors for the 
		local model can be given and the prediction can be computed for a number of lead 
		times using the iterative prediction scheme. The following parameters can be specified:</span><p>
		<span lang="en-us">&nbsp;-
		<b>fraction for test set (f)</b> : any number between 0.1 and 0.9. The 
		default is '0.5' meaning that the test set is the second half of the 
		time series. Typically <i>f</i> should be smaller or equal to 0.5, so that the 
		test set does not exceed in size the training set.&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p>
		<span lang="en-us">- <b>
		delay (t)</b>: any valid matlab format denoting an array of positive 
		integers or a single positive integer. The default is '1'. </span></p>
		<p>
		<span lang="en-us">- <b>embedding dimension (m)</b> : any valid matlab 
		format denoting an array of positive integers or a single positive 
		integer. The default is '1' meaning that no state space reconstruction 
		will be done and the points are simply the samples of the time series.</span></p>
		<p>
		<span lang="en-us">- <b>number of neighbors (k)</b> : any valid matlab 
		format denoting an array of positive integers or a single positive 
		integer. The default is '1' meaning that the computations of the 
		goodness of prediction measures will be done for the simplest local model 
		where the prediction is based on the mapping of the nearest neighbor of 
		the target point in the training set. This prediction is called also for 
		nearest neighbor prediction.&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p><span lang="en-us">- <b>prediction time (h)</b> : any valid 
		matlab format denoting an array of positive integers or a single 
		positive integer. The default is '1' meaning that the computations of 
		the goodness of prediction measures will be done only for one-step ahead.</span></p>
		<p><span lang="en-us">- <b>truncation parameter (q)</b> : any positive integer.

		local average model will be used. If <i>q</i><font face="Times New Roman"> 
		&#8805; <i>m</i></font> the standard local linear model with OLS solution for 
		the model parameters will be used. So, if the user wants to run this 
		model for a number of embedding dimensions, just use <i>q</i> larger 
		than the maximum of the selected embedding dimensions. If 0 &lt; <i>q</i>&nbsp;
