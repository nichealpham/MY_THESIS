		series in the current time series list</i>. Any subset

		specified). These are listed as distinct measures in the measure list 
		and they are identified by the label of the selected measure function (this is 
		the 10 character string in 
		parenthesis after the descriptive name of each measure) and characters 
		followed by numbers for each specified parameter (for the list of
