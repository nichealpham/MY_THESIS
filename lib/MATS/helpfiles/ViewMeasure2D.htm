		Select two measures</b>. For measures defined in terms of one or more 
		measure specific parameters, the measure name regards a specified set of 
		parameters (one parameter value for each name). A subset of time series 
		names can be selected from the respective lists with standard use of the 
		mouse: a click on a name and Shift^click on a another name further down 
		in the list selects all names between the former and the latter; a click 
		on a name and subsequent Ctrl^clicks on other names select these names 
		including the first name; Ctrl^a selects the whole list. To select the 
		two measures, click on the first measure name and then Ctrl^click on the 
		other measure name.</span></td>
