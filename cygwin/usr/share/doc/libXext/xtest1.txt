Introduction

This is a proposal for an extension to the X11 server and Xlib. It provides two
capabilities:

  * It allows a client to generate user input actions in the server without
    requiring a user to be present.

  * It also allows a client to control the handling of user input actions by
    the server.

The capability to allow a client to generate user input actions in the server
will be used by some of the X Testing Consortium Xlib tests. Both capabilities
will be used by the X Testing Consortium client exerciser program. These
capabilities may also be useful in other programs.

This extension requires modification to device-dependent code in the server.
Therefore it is not a 'portable' extension as defined by the X11 Server
Extensions document. However, the majority of the code and functionality of
this extension will be implementation-independent.

Conventions Used In This Document

The naming conventions used in the Xlib documentation are followed with these
additions:

  * The names of all functions defined in this extension begin with 'XTest',
    with the first letter of each additional word capitalized.

  * The names of the protocol request structures follow the Xlib convention of
    'x<name>Req'.

  * The names of the protocol request minor type codes follow the Xlib
    convention of 'X_<name>'.

  * The names of all other constants defined in this extension begin with
    'XTest', with the rest of the name in upper case letters.

  * All constants and structures defined in this extension will have their
    values specified in the 'xtestext1.h' file (listed in section 5).

Definition Of Terms

Input Actions

Input actions are pointer movements, button presses and releases, and key
presses and releases. They can be generated by a user or by a client (using
functions in this extension).

User Input Actions

User input actions are input actions that are generated by the user moving a
pointing device (typically a mouse), pressing and releasing buttons on the
pointing device, and pressing and releasing keys on the keyboard.

What Does This Extension Do?

Without this extension, user input actions are processed by the server, and are
converted into normal X events that are sent to the appropriate client or
clients.

This extension adds the following capabilities:

  * Input actions may be sent from a client to the server to be processed just
    as if the user had physically performed them. The input actions are
    provided to the server in the form of X protocol requests defined by this
    extension. The information provided to the server includes what action
    should be performed, and how long to delay before processing the action in
    the server.

  * User input actions may be diverted to a client before being processed by
    the server. The effect on the server is as if the user had performed no
    input action. The user input actions are provided to the client in the form
    of X events defined by this extension. The information provided to the
    client includes what user input action occurred and the delay between this
    user input action and the previous user input action. The client may then
    do anything it wishes with this information.

  * User input actions may be copied, with one copy going to the server in the
    normal way, and the other copy being sent to a client as described above.

Functions In This Extension

High Level Functions

These functions are built on top of the low level functions described later.

XTestMovePointer

int XTestMovePointer(Display *display, int device_id, unsigned long delay, int
x, int y, unsigned int count);

display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

          Specifies which pointer device was supposed to have caused the input
device_id action. This is a provision for future support of multiple
          (distinguishable) pointer devices, and should always be set to 0 for
          now.

delay     Specifies the time (in milliseconds) to wait before each movement of
          the pointer.

x, y      Specifies the x and y coordinates to move the pointer to relative to
          the root window for the specified display.

count     Specifies the number of 'delay, x, y' triplets contained in the delay
          , x and y arrays.

The XTestMovePointer function creates input actions to be sent to the the
server. The input actions will be accumulated in a request defined by this
extension until the request is full or the XTestFlush function is called. They
will then be sent to the server. When the input actions are sent to the server,
the input actions will cause the server to think that the pointer was moved to
the specified position(s), with the specified delay before each input action.

The XTestMovePointer function will return -1 if there is an error, and 0
otherwise.

XTestPressButton

int XTestPressButton(Display *display, int device_id, unsigned long delay,
unsigned int button_number, unsigned int button_action);

display       Specifies the connection to the X server.

              Specifies which button device was supposed to have caused the
device_id     input action. This is a provision for future support of multiple
              (distinguishable) button devices, and should always be set to 0
              for now.

delay         Specifies the time (in milliseconds) to wait before the input
              action.

button_number Specifies which button is being acted upon.

button_action Specifies the action to be performed (one of XTestPRESS, 
              XTestRELEASE, or XTestSTROKE).

The XTestPressButton function creates input actions to be sent to the the
server. The input actions will be accumulated in a request defined by this
extension until the request is full or the XTestFlush function is called. They
will then be sent to the server. When the input actions are sent to the server,
the input actions will cause the server to think that the specified button was
moved as specified.

The XTestPressButton function will return -1 if there is an error, and 0
otherwise.

XTestPressKey

int XTestPressKey(Display *display, int device_id, unsigned long delay,
unsigned int keycode, unsigned int key_action);

display    Specifies the connection to the X server.

           Specifies which keyboard device was supposed to have caused the
device_id  input action. This is a provision for future support of multiple
           (distinguishable) keyboard devices, and should always be set to 0
           for now.

delay      Specifies the time (in milliseconds) to wait before the input
           action.

keycode    Specifies which keycode is being acted upon.

key_action Specifies the action to be performed (one of XTestPRESS, 
           XTestRELEASE, or XTestSTROKE).

The XTestPressKey function creates input actions to be sent to the the server.
The input actions will be accumulated in a request defined by this extension
until the request is full or the XTestFlush function is called. They will then
be sent to the server. When the input actions are sent to the server, the input
actions will cause the server to think that the specified key on the keyboard
was moved as specified.

The XTestPressKey function will return -1 if there is an error, and 0
otherwise.

XTestFlush

int XTestFlush(Display *display);

display Specifies the connection to the X server.

The XTestFlush will send any remaining input actions to the server.

The XTestFlush function will return -1 if there is an error, and 0 otherwise.

Low Level Functions

XTestGetInput

int XTestGetInput(Display *display, int action_handling);

display         Specifies the connection to the X server.

                Specifies to the server what to do with the user input actions.
action_handling (one of 0, XTestPACKED_MOTION or XTestPACKED_ACTIONS;
                optionally 'or'ed with XTestEXCLUSIVE).

The XTestGetInput function tells the server to begin putting information about
user input actions into events to be sent to the client that called this
function. These events can be read via the Xlib XNextEventfR function.

The server assigns an event type of XTestInputActionType to these events to
distinguish them from other events. Since the actual value of the event type
may vary depending on how many extensions are included with an X11
implementation, XTestInputActionType is a variable that will be contained in
the Xlib part of this extension. It may be referenced as follows:

extern int XTestInputActionType;

  * An action_handling value of 0 causes the server to send one user input
    action in each XTestInputActionType event. This can sometimes cause
    performance problems.

  * An action_handling value of XTestPACKED_ACTIONS causes the server to pack
    as many user input actions as possible into a XTestInputActionType event.
    This is needed if user input actions are happening rapidly (such as when
    the user moves the pointer) to keep performance at a reasonable level.

  * An action_handling value of XTestPACKED_MOTION causes the server to pack
    only user input actions associated with moving the pointer. This allows the
    client to receive button and key motions as they happen without waiting for
    the event to fill up, while still keeping performance at a reasonable
    level.

  * An action_handling value with XTestEXCLUSIVE 'or'ed in causes the server to
    send user input actions only to the client. The effect on the server is as
    if the user had performed no input actions.

  * An action_handling value without XTestEXCLUSIVE causes the server to copy
    user input actions, sending one copy to the client, and handling the other
    copy normally (as it would if this extension were not installed).

There are four types of input actions that are passed from the server to the
client. They are:

                    This type of input action contains the keycode of the key
key/                or button that changed state; whether the key or button is
button~state~change up or down, and the time delay between this input action
                    and the previous input action.

                    This type of input action contains information about the
pointer~motions     motion of the pointer when the pointer has only moved a
                    short distance. If the pointer has moved a long distance,
                    the pointer jump input action is used.

                    This type of input action contains information about the
pointer~jumps       motion of the pointer when the pointer has moved a long
                    distance.

                    This type of input action is used when the delay between
delays              input actions is too large to be held in the other input
                    actions.

The XTestGetInput function will return -1 if there is an error, and 0
otherwise.

An error code of BadAccess means that another client has already requested that
user input actions be sent to it.

XTestStopInput

int XTestStopInput(Display *display);

display Specifies the connection to the X server.

The XTestStopInput function tells the server to stop putting information about
user input actions into events. The server will process user input actions
normally (as it would if this extension were not in the server).

The XTestStopInput function will return -1 if there is an error, and 0
otherwise.

An error code of BadAccess means that a request was made to stop input when
input has never been started.

XTestFakeInput

int XTestFakeInput(Display *display, char *action_list_addr, int
action_list_size, int ack_flag);

display          Specifies the connection to the X server.

action_list_addr Specifies the address of an list of input actions to be sent
                 to the server.

action_list_size Specifies the size (in bytes) of the list of input actions. It
                 may be no larger than XTestMAX_ACTION_LIST_SIZE bytes.

                 Specifies whether the server needs to send an event to
ack_flag         indicate that its input action buffer is empty (one of 
                 XTestFAKE_ACK_NOT_NEEDED or XTestFAKE_ACK_REQUEST).

The XTestFakeInput function tells the server to take the specified user input
actions and process them as if the user had physically performed them.

The server can only accept a limited number of input actions at one time. This
limit can be determined by the XTestQueryInputSize function in this extension.

The client should set ack_flag to XTestFAKE_ACK_NOT_NEEDED on calls to 
XTestFakeInput that do not reach this limit.

The client should set ack_flag to XTestFAKE_ACK_REQUEST on the call to 
XTestFakeInput that reaches this limit.

When the server sees an ack_flag value of XTestFAKE_ACK_REQUEST it finishes
processing its input action buffer, then sends an event with type 
XTestFakeAckType to the client. When the client reads this event, it knows that
it is safe to resume sending input actions to the server.

Since the actual value of the event type may vary depending on how many
extensions are included with an X11 implementation, XTestFakeAckType is a
variable that is contained in the Xlib part of this extension. It may be
referenced as follows:

extern int XTestFakeAckType;

There are four types of input actions that are passed from the client to the
server. They are:

                    This type of input action contains the keycode of the key
key/                or button that is to change state; whether the key or
button~state~change button is to be up or down, and the time to delay before
                    changing the state of the key or button.

                    This type of input action contains information about the
                    motion of the pointer when the pointer is to be moved a
pointer~motions     short distance, and the time to delay before moving the
                    pointer. If the pointer is to be moved a long distance, the
                    pointer jump input action must be used.

                    This type of input action contains information about the
pointer~jumps       motion of the pointer when the pointer is to be moved a
                    long distance, and the time to delay before moving the
                    pointer.

                    This type of input action is used when the delay between
delays              input actions is too large to be held in the other input
                    actions.

The XTestFakeInput function will return -1 if there is an error, and 0
otherwise.

An error code of \fIBadAccess\fR means that another client has already sent
user input actions to the server, and the server has not finished processing
the user input actions.

XTestQueryInputSize

int XTestQueryInputSize(Display *display, unsigned long size_return);

display     Specifies the connection to the X server.

size_return Returns the number of input actions that the server's input action
            buffer can hold.

The XTestQueryInputSize function asks the server to return the number of input
actions that it can hold in its input action buffer in the unsigned long
pointed to by \fIsize_return\fR.

The XTestQueryInputSize function will return -1 if there is an error, and 0
otherwise.

XTestReset

int XTestReset(Display *display);

display Specifies the connection to the X server.

The XTestReset function tells the server to set everything having to do with
this extension back to its initial state. After this call the server will act
as if this extension were not installed until one of the extension functions is
called by a client. This function is not normally needed, but is included in
case a client wishes to clean up the server state, such as after a serious
error.

The XTestReset function will return -1 if there is an error, and 0 otherwise.
