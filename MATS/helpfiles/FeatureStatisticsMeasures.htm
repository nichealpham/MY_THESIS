		group are oscillation characteristics and are meaningful for oscillating 
		time series. Each oscillation can be roughly, but often sufficiently, 
		described by four features, the peak (local maximum) and trough 
		(local minimum) of the oscillation, the time duration of the oscillation 
		(e.g. from one peak to the next) and the time from peak to trough (or 
		equivalently from trough to peak). A fifth feature that can be 
		useful at cases, especially in the presence of drifts in the time 
		series, is formed by the difference of the peaks from the corresponding 
		troughs. The first two features constitute the turning points of 
		the time series and have been used in the analysis of other 
		non-oscillating time series, e.g. in finance.</span><p>
		<span lang="en-us">For the computation of the features the turning 
		points have to be identified first. A sample point of the time 
		series is a turning point, i.e. local minimum (maximum), if it is the smallest (largest) of 
		the samples of the time series in a data window centered in this sample 
		point. The <i>data window size</i> is given as 2<i>w</i>+1 for a given offset 
		value <i>w</i>. For noisy time series, smoothing prior to the turning point 
		detection is suggested and this is implemented here with a <i>moving 
		average filter </i>of a given order. Standard descriptive statistics are 
		given as measures from each of the five oscillating features.</span></p>

		moving average filter order (a)</b>: any valid matlab format denoting an 
		array of positive integers or a single positive integer. The default is 
		'1' meaning that no filter is applied as there is only the target point 
		in the moving window for averaging. The moving average filter runs 
		through the time series (forward direction), then the filtered time 
		series is reversed and the same moving average filter runs through it 
		(backward direction). In this way, there is no phase distortion. Note 
		that a change of the value of <i>a</i> in the first feature of Local 
		Maxima is passed to the parameter <i>a</i> of the other four features.</span></p><p><span lang="en-us">
		- <b>offset for local window (w)</b>: any valid matlab format denoting 
		an array of positive integers or a single positive integer. The default 
		is '1' meaning that the local window is comprised of the target sample 
		point in the center, the preceding sample point and the succeeding 
		sample point. The length of the local window is 2<i>w</i>+1. A sample point <i>
		x<sub>i</sub></i> is a local maximum (minimum) if it is the maximum 
		(minimum) of the samples {<i>x<sub>i-w</sub></i>,...,<i>x<sub>i</sub></i>,...,<i>x<sub>i+w</sub></i>}.
