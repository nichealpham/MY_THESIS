		dynamical systems observed from time series are identified in terms of 
		their <i>invariant measures</i> as estimated from the time series. Some 
		invariant measures are associated with the dimension and complexity of 
		the underlying to time series system, or more specifically, to the 
		<i>attractor</i>, the set of points or trajectories generated by the dynamical 
		system.</span><p><span lang="en-us">The <i>correlation dimension</i> is 
		an invariant measure of the attractors fractal dimension and it is the 
		most popular among other similar fractal dimension measures, such as the 
		information and box-counting dimension. The correlation dimension 
		measures the self-similarity property of the so-called <i>strange 
		attractors</i>, i.e. attractors that possess this property and have a 
		non-integer fractal dimension. The &quot;regular&quot; attractors, which are 
		objects or set of points that can be sufficiently described in terms of 
		the 
		topological and Euclidean dimension, have an integer correlation 
		dimension. The correlation dimension is based on the density of points 
		of the attractor and this makes possible to estimate it from the sample 
		density of the points reconstructed from the time series, typically from 
		delay embedding for a delay <i>t</i> and an embedding dimension <i>m</i>. 
		The estimation starts with the computation of the so-called <i>
		correlation sum</i> <i>C</i>(<i>r</i>) (abusively, it is also called <i>
		correlation integral</i>), which is calculated for a range of radii <i>
		r</i>. For each <i>r</i>, <i>C</i>(<i>r</i>) is the average fraction of points within 
		this radius<i> r</i> (<i>r</i> is referred to as radius because 
		the Euclidean norm is used to compute the inter-point distances of all 
		points from each reference point). Given 
		that the underlying dynamical system is deterministic, the correlation sum 
		scales with the power of <i>r</i> as <i>C</i>(<i>r</i>) ~ <i>r</i></span><i><sup>í</sup></i>,<span lang="en-us"> 
		and the exponent <i>v</i> is the correlation dimension. Theoretically, 
		the scaling should hold for very small <i>r</i> (<i>r </i>
		<font face="Times New Roman">&#8594;0), but in practice the scaling is bounded 
		at small <i>r</i> by the lack of close points (dependent on the length 
		of the time series) and the masking of noise (even for noise-free data a 
		lower bound for <i>r</i> is set by the round-off error).</font> Computationally, for 
		the estimation of </span><i>í</i><span lang="en-us">, first&nbsp; the 
		local slope of the graph of log(<i>C</i>(<i>r</i>)) vs log(<i>r</i>) is 
		computed by the smooth derivative of log(<i>C</i>(<i>r</i>)) with 
		respect to log(<i>r</i>). Provided that the scaling <i>C</i>(<i>r</i>) ~
		<i>r</i></span><i><sup>í<span lang="en-us"> </span></sup></i>
		<span lang="en-us">exists at least for a sufficiently large range of <i>
		r</i>, a horizontal plateau of the local slope vs log(<i>r</i>) should 
		be formed for this range of <i>r</i>. The least size of the range is 
		usually given in terms of the ratio of the upper edge r<sub>2</sub> to the lower edge 
		r<sub>1</sub> of the scaling <i>r</i>-interval, and a commonly used ratio is r<sub>2</sub>/r<sub>1 </sub>= 4. 
		Here, the estimate of </span><i>í </i><span lang="en-us">is the mean 
		local slope in the interval [r<sub>1</sub>,r<sub>2</sub>] with the least 
		variance of the local slope.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
		<p><span lang="en-us">In real world applications, reliable 
		estimation of </span><i>í</i><span lang="en-us"> can be hard (meaning 
		that the 
		variance of the local slope is large) which indicates that there is no 
		clear scaling. 
		In that cases, other simpler measures derived from the correlation sum 
		may be more useful, such as the 
		value of the correlation sum <i>C</i>(<i>r</i>) for a given <i>r</i>, 
		which is simply the cumulative density function of inter-point distances 
		at a given inter-point distance, or the value of <i>r</i> that 
		corresponds to a given <i>C</i>(<i>r</i>), which is the inverse 
		of this cumulative density.</span></p>
		<p><span lang="en-us">The <i>embedding dimension m</i> is an important 
		parameter for the analysis of time series from the dynamical system 
		approach, and determines the dimension of the Euclidean pseudo-space in 
		which supposedly the attractor is reconstructed from the time series. An
		<i>m</i> that is small but sufficiently large to unfold the attractor is 
		sought and a popular method to estimate it is the <i>false nearest 
		neighbors</i>. This method increases the embedding dimension by one at 
		each step and counts the percentage of points for which its nearest 
		neighbor falls apart with the addition of a new component (from 
		embedding dimension <i>m</i> to <i>m</i>+1), and therefore these points 
		are called false nearest neighbors. The estimated minimum embedding 
		dimension is the one that first gives an insignificant percentage of 
		false nearest neighbors. Though the minimum <i>m</i> is not an invariant 
		measure, as it depends for example on the delay parameter <i>t</i>, it 
		is used in some applications as a measure to discriminate different 
		dynamical regimes and it is therefore included here as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;
