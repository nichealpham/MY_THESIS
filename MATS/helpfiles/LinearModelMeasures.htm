		models for stationary time series are the autoregressive (AR) models and 
		the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models. Here these models are 
		implemented in order to derive statistical measures of fitting and prediction for 
		varying model orders and prediction steps. The difference between the fitting 
		and prediction measures is in the set of samples that are used to 
		compute the statistical measure: all the samples are used for fitting and the 
		samples in the so-called test set for prediction. Here, the test set is the last 
		part of the time series. For multi-step fit or prediction the iterative 
		scheme is used and the one step predictions from previous steps are used 
		to make predictions for the current step. </span>

		encountered, the mean square error (MSE), the normalized mean square 
		error (NMSE), the normalized root mean square error (NMSE) and the
