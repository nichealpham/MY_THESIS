		resampled time series of a specific type, i.e. time series with names 
		containing indices after the string code of the specified resampling 
		type, can be plotted against the resampling indices in a figure window. 
		This type of figure visualizes the result of the resampling test for a 
		time series, comparing the measure(s) value for the original time series 
		at index 0 to the other values of the resampled time series at the other 
		indices. Further, the user is opted to select to get a graph of ordered 
		values and test results (p-values of a parametric test and nonparametric 
		test).</span><p><span lang="en-us">First, the <b>Resampling type</b> 
		must be chosen among the listed resampling types (RP, FT, AAFT, IAAFT, 
		STAP, AMRB, see &quot;Resampled Time Series&quot; operation). Upon the selection 
		of the resampling type the list of resampled time series is restricted 
		to include only resampled time series of the specified type. If for 
		example, the STAP resampling type is specified, the label on the top of 
		the list reads <b>Select STAP resampled time series </b>and the list 
		contains all the STAP surrogate time series for which measures have been 
		computed in the last run of measures. </span></p>
		<p><span lang="en-us">The resampled time series in the list are 
		identified for the specified resampling type by the time series name and 
		the indices after the string code of the specified resampling type (if 
		there is a string after the index this should be the same in the names 
		of the segments). If no such resampled time series names exist the list 
		of resampled time series is empty and this operation cannot run for this 
		resampling type. Further, one or more measures can be selected from the 
		measure list having the title <b>Select one or more measures</b>. For 
		measures defined in terms of one or more measure specific parameters, 
		the measure name regards a specified set of parameters (one parameter 
		value for each name). A subset of resampled time series and measure 
		names can be selected from the respective lists with standard use of the 
		mouse: a click on a name and Shift^click on a another name further down 
		in the list selects all names between the former and the latter; a click 
		on a name and subsequent Ctrl^clicks on other names select these names 
		including the first name; Ctrl^a selects the whole list. 
		</span></p>
		<p><span lang="en-us"><i>Tips</i>: For the selection of a subset of resampled time series names from the list, 
		click on the resampled time series of this subset appearing first in the 
		list and then Shift^click at the last resampled time series in the list. In this way, all time series from the 
		first selected to the last time series in the list will be marked and 
		from those only the ones that have the same resampled time series name 
		as the first one and differ only to the resampling index will be 
		processed.</span></td>

      <span lang="en-us">The resampling test here is for the null hypothesis of 
		linear stochastic process using surrogate data generated by the STAP 
		algorithm on a time series of EEG from an epileptic seizure (exhibiting 
		rhythmic oscillations and thus expected nonlinear dynamics to be present 
		and the null hypothesis to be rejected). We note that for two of the 
		four measures displayed in the figure above, the cumulative 
		bicorrelation for maximum lag 10 (blue line) and the cumulative mutual 
		information using equiprobable binning of automatically selected number 
		of bins and maximum lag 10 (red line), it is obvious that the original 
		values for both measures are well above the respective values of the 
		resampled data. The distinction is less clear for the measure of the fit 
		with a local zero order model of 10 neighbors, lag one, embedding 
		dimension 10 and predicting 5 time steps ahead using the direct 
		prediction scheme (black dashed line). However, this does not mean that 
		the rejection of the null hypothesis is less confident by this nonlinear 
		measure. It is just that the range for this measure is much smaller, as 
		is for the forth measure of the linear autoregressive (AR) fit for the 
		same prediction and using AR order 10. </span>
		<p>
      <span lang="en-us">To visualize better the graphs for the two last 
		measures (the nonlinear and linear fit measures) we should use the 
		option &quot;Normalize&quot;. Moreover, to obtain quantitative results as well&nbsp; 
		for these two measures, we select only these two, and activate the 
		checkboxes&nbsp; &quot;Normalize&quot; and &quot;Display test&quot;. By then pressing the 
		button &quot;View selected plot&quot; two figures are generated in separate 
		windows as shown below (for the test statistic of the linear fit on the 
		first figure and the test statistic of the nonlinear fit on the second 
		figure).</span><p>

      <span lang="en-us">It is obvious that for the linear fit the value for the 
		original EEG data is well within the distribution of the values from the 
		STAP surrogate time series (the open circle is above both the two red 
		horizontal lines and towards zero). Accordingly, the p-values of both 
		the parametric and the nonparametric test are large (displayed at the 
		title of the figure). We note that the set of measure values for the 
		resampled data form a distribution that is accepted to be normal as 
		given by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and this result is displayed in 
		the title as &quot;normality accepted&quot;. So, we can trust the result of the 
		parametric test. The test results for the nonlinear fit test statistic 
		given in the second figure above, suggest that the null hypothesis for 
		linear stochastic process should be rejected at very low significance 
		level when using the parametric approach and at the smallest significant 
		level of </span><font face="Times New Roman">&#8776;0.02<span lang="en-us">5 
		when using the nonparametric approach. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test 
		suggests here that the test statistic values on the resampled data do 
		not follow normal distribution (stated as &quot;normality rejected&quot; in the
